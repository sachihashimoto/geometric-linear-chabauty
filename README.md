# geometric-linear-chabauty
Code associated to the paper 'A Geometric Linear Chabauty Comparison Theorem' by Sachi Hashimoto and Pim Spelier <https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04967>.
Code for finding genus 3 examples where geometric linear Chabauty outperforms Chabautyâ€”Coleman.
For more information, see Examples 5.7 and 5.8 and the comments in genus3batchcode.m.

To run the code, you need to download 
<http://www.mathe2.uni-bayreuth.de/stoll/magma/Kum3/G3Hyp.m>,
<https://github.com/steffenmueller/QCMod/blob/main/mws_qc.m>
and the entire repository
<https://github.com/jtuitman/Coleman>.
The Coleman integration code currently (as of June 2021) runs on older version of Magma, the geometric linear Chabauty code has been tested only on Magma V2.24-5.
